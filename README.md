# Custom-encryption

Basic encryption through reversed ascii-cycling

  - reversing letters of string
  - shifting each letter based on ascii value
  - wrapping ends of ascii writable characters in table

Takes in user input and check for errors using try and except structure => only allows valid words for encryption
  
Testing encrypted function by decrypting them using a testing method and checking for matches
  - reversing above process for match
